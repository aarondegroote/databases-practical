# Designing an ER diagram

A webshop wants to improve and automate selling smartphones using there website. To achieve this they need have a database that will contain all the information about the phones.

If we take a look at there current webpage, we can see that smartphones have multiple properties: name, camera quality, battery prestation, screen size, price, and availability (green vs blue shopping icon), number of reviews.

It is your job to design a database that can manage the data needed to be shown on the webpage. You only need to create a physical ER diagram.
