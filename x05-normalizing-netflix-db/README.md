# Normalizing a Netflix database

Below you will be presented an ER diagrams for a possible database design. The designs might not be normalized. It is your task to normalize the database design so that the data can be stored correctly without any problems reading, updating, inserting or deleting any data. The design should be at least in **2NF**.

If needed, or if it results in a better design, the properties in your proposal can be renamed to a more suited name.

If there should exist many-to-many relations, please describe the association table as well.

The solution can be presented using _logical ER_ diagrams.

Describe the steps you followed to get the database in NF1 and NF2.

You can use [Lucidchart.com](https://www.lucidchart.com) to draw the diagrams.

This database should hold a list of movie titles and users. Every user should be able to mark if a movie belongs to his favorites or not. Movies and users without favorite marks should be allowed to be stored.
